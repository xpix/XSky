perl-GPS

This is a perl interface to a GPS receiver that implements the Garmin
protocol.

Several functions are still missing. The Garmin device support list is
still very thin, but adding new devices should be fairly easy.

You require perl 5.005 or later to use this library. On Win32, the
Win32::SerialPort module is required. On Unix, the Device::SerialPort
module is recommended (though not strictly required). On all systems a
module implementing "weaken" (either WeakRef or Scalar::Util, the
latter is standard in perl 5.8.0) is recommended to avoid filehandle
and memory leakage because of circular references. There is no
"weaken" support for perl 5.005 available, so be prepared for these
leakages on older systems.

You install the library by running these commands:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

(Replace "make" by "nmake" on Windows systems).
