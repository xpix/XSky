0.15
	- added support for some Garmin devices (eTrex vista/vista c,
	  gecko)
	- beginning support for route up/download
	- documentation improvements

	  any improvements in stability)

	- added support for newer Garmin devices: eTrex Venture and emap
	- added optional /bin/stty support to Garmin::Serial
	- no dependencies to (even standard) modules like POSIX and

	  waypoint types etc.
